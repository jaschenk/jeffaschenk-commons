===================

Sharing this mash up of Common Facilities which I have developed and used in various projects in hopes some substance could be reused or inspire a new creation.

In the process of Refactoring a good majority of my code mashed up into some usable form.

This is my developed JAVA Code, at least what can be shared, from the year 2000 through present day.  

I had a series of C and Assembly Language code on Tape Backup, but not sure if I still have those.  If I ever come across will post as well.
